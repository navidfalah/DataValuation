# Diversity and Relevance Analysis Package 📈

Welcome to the Diversity and Relevance Analysis Package! This Python package 📦 is your go-to toolkit for analyzing datasets. It allows you to generate synthetic data 🧪, compute eigenvalues 🔢, and evaluate the diversity 🌈 and relevance 🎯 of your data. Plus, it comes with neat visualization tools for plotting data distributions 📊 and eigenvalues.

## Features

- 🎲 **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create datasets with specific covariance properties using `numpy`.
- 🔍 **Eigenvalue Computation**: Extract eigenvalues from your covariance matrices for analysis.
- 📐 **Diversity and Relevance Metrics**: Quantify how diverse and relevant your datasets are.
- 📉 **Data Visualization**: Visualize your datasets and analysis results with `matplotlib`.
