# Diversity and Relevance Analysis Package 📈

This Python package 📦 provides a suite of tools for generating synthetic data 🧪 based on covariance matrices, computing eigenvalues 🔢, and calculating the diversity 🌈 and relevance 🎯 of datasets. It is equipped with visualization tools for plotting data distributions 📊 and eigenvalues.

## Features

- Generate synthetic data with `numpy`'s multivariate normal distribution 🎲.
- Calculate eigenvalues, diversity, and relevance from data matrices 📐.
- Visualize data distributions and eigenvalues with `matplotlib` 📉.

## Modules

- `data_generation`: Functionality to generate synthetic data.
- `covariance_analysis`: Compute eigenvalues and the proposed diversity and relevance metrics.
- `visualization`: Plotting functions to visualize results.
- `main`: The main execution script that ties together all the modules.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the analysis:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this package to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

    Run the main.py script to execute the analysis:

bash

python main.py
